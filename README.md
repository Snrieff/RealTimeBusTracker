# RealTimeBusTracker

This project is a real-time bus tracker website that tracks the Route 1 north and south buses of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MTBA). The website utilizes a Google Maps API to display the current location of the buses on a map, as well as provide real-time bus tracking using the MTBA API.

<b>Project Overview</b>
<p>This project was created as a part of the MIT xPRO Coding Professional Certificate program, and it aims to demonstrate proficiency in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project incorporates both the Google Maps API and the MTBA API to provide a real-time tracking of the buses.</p>

The website provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to locate where each bus on Route 1 is located every 15 seconds.

<b>Project Features</b>
<ol>Real-time tracking of multiple bus routes</ol>
<ol>User-friendly interface with interactive map display</ol>

<p>Created using resources from the MIT xPRO Coding Professional Certificate program
Utilizes the Google Maps API and the MTBA API for real-time bus tracking</p>
